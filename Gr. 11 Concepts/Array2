Program Name: Array2
Date: 2021-09-27
Program discription: This program asks the user for a number of students and the number of tests that each student has done. It then finds the average mark of each student.
It then finds the highest(s) marks and outputs the students with those marks. It then outputs a list of students with a mark higher than the class average.
